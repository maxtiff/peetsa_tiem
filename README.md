This recipe from Peter Reinhert uses American bread flour instead of Italian -00- flour. You can use Italian flour, such as Caputo, if you want to make an authentic Napoletana dough. Just cut back on the water by about 2 ounces; Italian flour does not absorb as much as the higher protein American flour. Always use unbleached flour for better flavor. If you want to make it more like a coal-oven-style dough, add 1 tablespoon of sugar or honey. Regarding moisture content, the key is to make it wet enough so that the cornicione (the edge or crown) really puffs in the oven.

### Ingredients

*	5 1/4 cups (24 ounces by weight) unbleached bread flour

*	2 teaspoons (0.5 oz.) kosher salt

*	1 1/4 teaspoons (0.14 oz.) instant yeast (or 1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast dissolved in the water)

*	2 tablespoons (1 oz.) olive oil

*	2 1/4 cups (18 oz.) room temperature water (less if using honey or oil)


### Directions for making dough

1)	Using the mixer's paddle attachment, combine all the dry ingredients in the bowl and mix until evenly distributed.

2)	Add in wet ingredients and continue to mix for one minute on medium to low speed, to form a coarse, sticky dough ball.

3)	Let the dough rest for five minutes, then mix again on medium speed for one minute to make a smooth, very tacky ball of dough.

4)	Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled work surface

5)	Rub a little oil on your hands, and fold the dough into a smooth ball. Let it rest on the work surface for 5 minutes 

6)	After the 5 minutes have elapsed, stretch and fold the dough into a tight ball. Let the dough ball rest for 5 minutes. 

	  > Repeat step 6 two more times, at 5 minute intervals. 
	  > The dough ball should have been worked three times with a resting period inbetween each working, with two resting periods combined at 10 minutes total.

7) Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and immediately place in the refrigerator. 

	  > The dough can be used anywhere from 6 hours to 3 days after it goes in the fridge. The dough is ideal after resting for 24 hours, therby allowing the yeast enough time to carry out the fermentation process for deeper flavors.


### Directions for prepping dough

When ready to make the pizzas, pull the dough from the refrigerator two hours prior to baking. 

1)	Divide the dough into five 8-ounce pieces (if there is any extra dough divide it evenly among the dough balls). 

2)	With either oil or flour on your hands, form each piece into a tight dough ball and place on a lightly oiled pan. 

3)	Mist the dough balls with spray oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap or place the pan inside a large plastic bag. 

	  * Give the dough at least 90 minutes before making the pizzas. 
	  * If you donâ€™t plan to use them all, place the extra dough balls inside of an oiled freezer bag and keep in the refrigerator (<= 3 days) or in the freezer (<= 3 months).
